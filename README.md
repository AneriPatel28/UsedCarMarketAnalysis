# Used Car Market Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the used car market by exploring a comprehensive dataset of over 90,000 used cars spanning from 1970 to 2024. The main goal is to provide actionable insights into used car sales trends through both static plots and an interactive dashboard, helping potential buyers and sellers make informed decisions.

## Objectives
- **Develop static plots** to understand market trends, pricing structures, and vehicle conditions across different manufacturers.
- **Create an interactive dashboard** that allows users to explore various metrics like price, mileage, fuel efficiency, and more to find cars that fit their needs.
- **Deploy the application on Google Cloud Platform** for easy accessibility and high availability.
- **Empower users** by simplifying the data analysis process with a user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization
- Dash for the interactive dashboard component
- Hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

## Features
- Multiple static analysis visualizations
- An interactive dashboard to explore various dimensions of the data
- User customization options in the dashboard to filter data according to specific needs

## Installation
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/used-car-market-analysis.git
cd used-car-market-analysis
```

Install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To generate static plots:
```bash
python Project_PhaseI.py
```

To run the dashboard:
```bash
python Project_PhaseII_pt2.py
```

Ensure that the 'assets' directory is present in the same folder as `Project_PhaseII_pt2.py` to load all the images and styles for the dashboard correctly.
